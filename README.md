## Random Notes
I wrote this library a long time ago and only recently dusted it off.  I seem to remember getting a reference for the I2CDevice from somewhere, but I cannot track down where I found it.  I think I've modified it enough to avoid any copyright issues, and I remember it being open sourced.  If you are the original author or recognize your work please let me know for proper attribution.
